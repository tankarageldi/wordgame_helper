# Zen Word Game Solver

My girlfriend loves this game, so I made this simple program to help her find words when she gets stuck.

## Usage

Enter the words shown on the game, as an input with no spaces or special characters, for example : cnat (length n)

The program will generate all combinations of these letters starting from 3 letter words up to n letter words.

Then compare these combinations with valid english words, which i got from words.json file.
